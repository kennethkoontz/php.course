##Introduction
Geekwise PHP is an introductory course that teaches the basics of the PHP language and implementing functional Web Applications. Although not required, basic knowledge of HTML/CSS is good to have as PHP blends these technologies together to create a functional application. For the first few weeks, each student will study the PHP language while participating in practical application of course material learned in each session. Using the material learned from the first few weeks, the last few weeks will be used to design a function Web Application. 

##What is expected?
There is no homework assigned throughout the course. All work will be hands-on and will be covered in each session. Each practical application of a topic will be covered after discussing the topic. Each topic, whether directly or indirectly, will be used to provide building blocks to create the final Web Application. Because there is no homework, it is encouraged that you follow along with the material and ask questions. We all are learning and this is probably one of the more important traits to possess as a software developer in the industry. So please ask questions and we will work through it. But most importantly, have fun!
